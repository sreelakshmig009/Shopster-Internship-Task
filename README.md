## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Sharing your solution

Once you are done, upload your code to github. Then, send a mail to team@shopster.ai along with the Github link. We will get in touch with you after reviewing your work.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
